           <h2>Reflection on *Twelve Pillars*</h2>
           <p>In chapters 4–7 of Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, I learned the importance of taking personal responsibility for my life,
               continuously striving for personal growth and surrounding myself with positive relationships. Success is shaped by the choices I make daily and it requires constant learning and self-improvement.
                Building strong relationships with those who inspire and uplift me is essential for long-term fulfillment. Additionally, discipline and consistency are key to achieving goals;
                progress comes from forming good habits and maintaining them over time..</p>
           <p>I can apply these lessons by taking ownership of my decisions, committing to lifelong learning, nurturing supportive relationships and developing disciplined routines that align with my aspirations.</p>

           <h2>My Degree Program</h2>
           <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and through hands-on projects, such as creating a portfolio website using HTML5 and CSS, I have gained practical experience in designing and building responsive web pages.
Additionally, my coursework has honed my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities, allowing me to approach complex challenges methodically and efficiently.These skills are not only vital in programming but also in analyzing systems and finding innovative solutions in technology.</p>
